    I (Addae) am a composer, percussionist, and a southern California native based in Los Angeles. I write for chamber ensembles and solo instruments. Iâ€™ve been creating a body of work for jazz musicians and electronic music lying between minimalism, avant-garde jazz and electronic dance music. A third area of my practice is installation art including painting, sculpture and design. My other research interests include Afrofuturist aesthetics, horticulture and urban farming.
